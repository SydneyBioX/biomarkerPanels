Description: Tools to construct and evaluate small biomarker panels via
    multi-objective optimization with user-specified performance targets such as
    sensitivity at fixed specificity, cost budgets, and clinical interpretability.
    Integrates with Bioconductor data structures to streamline workflows from
    expression matrices to deployable panels.
