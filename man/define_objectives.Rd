\title{Define optimization objectives.}
\usage{
define_objectives(
  losses = c("sensitivity", "specificity"),
  custom = NULL,
  params = list(),
  directions = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{losses}{Character vector of registered loss names (default:
\code{c("sensitivity", "specificity")}).}

\item{custom}{Optional named list of objective descriptors with elements
\code{label}, \code{direction}, and \code{fun}.}

\item{params}{Named list of additional argument lists for specific losses.}

\item{directions}{Optional named vector overriding loss directions.}
}
\value{
Named list of objective descriptors.
}
\description{
Assemble a list of objective descriptors ready for consumption by the
optimization engine. Built-in losses are pulled from the registry created in
\code{\link[=build_objectives]{build_objectives()}}; custom entries may be appended for experimental goals.
