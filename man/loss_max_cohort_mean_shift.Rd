\title{Maximum Mean Shift Across Cohorts}
\usage{
loss_max_cohort_mean_shift(
  truth,
  scores = NULL,
  selected = NULL,
  cohort = NULL,
  x = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{truth}{Binary outcome; coerced with \code{\link[=ensure_binary_response]{ensure_binary_response()}}.}

\item{scores}{Numeric scores or probabilities.}

\item{selected}{Ignored; kept for signature compatibility.}

\item{cohort}{Factor indicating cohort membership.}

\item{x}{Matrix of selected feature values (samples x features).}
}
\value{
Maximum pairwise distance between cohort means.
}
\description{
Computes pairwise distances between cohort-specific mean expression vectors
for the selected features and returns the maximum distance. Encourages panels
whose selected biomarkers exhibit similar distributions across cohorts.
