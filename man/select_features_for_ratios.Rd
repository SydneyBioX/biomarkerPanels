\usage{
select_features_for_ratios(
  x_list,
  y_list,
  contrast = NULL,
  n_stable = 50L,
  n_informative = 50L,
  stability_method = c("precision_weighted", "cv_t_stats", "inverse_t_se"),

  assay = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{x_list}{A matrix-like object, \code{SummarizedExperiment}, or list of such
objects. Rows represent samples and columns represent features. When a list
is supplied each element is treated as an independent cohort.}

\item{y_list}{A binary response aligned with \code{x_list}. Must be a factor with
levels \code{c("No", "Yes")}. Provide a list when \code{x_list} is a list.}

\item{contrast}{Optional contrast string (or list of strings) passed to
\code{\link[limma:makeContrasts]{limma::makeContrasts()}}. Defaults to \code{"Yes-No"} to align with
\code{\link[=ensure_binary_response]{ensure_binary_response()}}.}

\item{n_stable}{Number of approximately invariant features to return
(default \code{50}).}

\item{n_informative}{Number of informative features to return (default \code{50}).}

\item{stability_method}{Method used to score stability. One of
\code{"precision_weighted"}, \code{"cv_t_stats"}, or \code{"inverse_t_se"}.}

\item{combination_method}{Method for combining cohort-specific z-scores.
One of \code{"OSP"}, \code{"Stouffer"}, \code{"Fisher"}, or \code{"maxP"}.}

\item{assay}{For \code{SummarizedExperiment} inputs, the assay name or index to
extract prior to modelling.}
}
\value{
A list with elements \code{stable} and \code{informative}, each containing a
character vector of feature identifiers.
}
\description{
Identifies both highly informative (differentially expressed) features and
features with stable expression across cohorts, supporting ratio-based panel
design. Stability can be measured via precision-weighted inverse t-statistics,
coefficient-of-variation penalties, or inverse t-statistic standard errors.
