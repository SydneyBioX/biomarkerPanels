\usage{
select_panel_by_pathway(
  high_sensitivity_panels,
  inclusion_frequency,
  pathway_mapping,
  relevant_pathways,
  feature_performance,
  panel_size = 4L,
  min_sensitivity = 0.5,
  sensitivity_col = "external_sens_at_spec90",
  top_frequency = panel_size
)
}
\arguments{
\item{high_sensitivity_panels}{List of character vectors (or
\code{BiomarkerPanelResult} objects) representing high-performing panels.}

\item{inclusion_frequency}{Data frame from \code{\link[=compute_inclusion_frequencies]{compute_inclusion_frequencies()}}.}

\item{pathway_mapping}{Data frame with at least columns \code{feature} and
\code{pathway}. Optional columns \code{pathway_name} and \code{source} provide additional
context.}

\item{relevant_pathways}{Character vector of pathway identifiers (matched
against \code{pathway_mapping$pathway}) that are known to be implicated in the
disease under study.}

\item{feature_performance}{Data frame containing per-feature performance
summaries. Must include columns \code{feature} and the column referenced by
\code{sensitivity_col}.}

\item{panel_size}{Desired final panel size (default \code{4}).}

\item{min_sensitivity}{Minimum acceptable sensitivity at 90\% specificity for
biomarkers selected via pathway enrichment.}

\item{sensitivity_col}{Column name in \code{feature_performance} holding the
sensitivity estimates (defaults to \code{"external_sens_at_spec90"}).}

\item{top_frequency}{Optional number of highly frequent biomarkers to add to
the candidate pool (defaults to \code{panel_size}).}
}
\value{
A list containing \code{features} (selected biomarker identifiers) and
\code{pathway_assignments} describing the mapping between selected biomarkers
and pathways. The returned vector may be shorter than \code{panel_size} if the
constraints cannot be satisfied.
}
\description{
Select biomarkers guided by pathway information.
