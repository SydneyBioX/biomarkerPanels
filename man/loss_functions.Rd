\title{Default loss functions for biomarker panel optimization.}
\description{
These functions compute scalar metrics such as sensitivity, specificity,
concordance index, and panel size. They share a common signature so that the
package can compose them into multi-objective optimization routines.
}
\details{
Each loss accepts a binary response (\code{truth}), numeric prediction scores
(\code{scores}), and optionally the currently selected feature set (\code{selected}).
Additional parameters (for example, classification thresholds) can be supplied
via \code{\link[=build_objectives]{build_objectives()}}.
