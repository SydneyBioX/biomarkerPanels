\usage{
evaluate_panel(
  panel,
  x,
  y,
  objectives = define_objectives(losses = c("sensitivity", "specificity", "c_index")),
  cohort = NULL,
  assay = NULL,
  scoring_fn = NULL,
  cohort_aggregator = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{panel}{A \code{BiomarkerPanelResult}.}

\item{x}{Validation feature matrix, \code{data.frame}, \code{SummarizedExperiment}, or a
list of such objects for multi-cohort evaluation.}

\item{y}{Validation binary response factor (or list of factors when \code{x} is a
list).}

\item{objectives}{Optional override for objectives. Defaults to sensitivity,
specificity, and c_index.}

\item{cohort}{Optional factor identifying cohort membership for each sample
when \code{x} represents a single cohort. Ignored when \code{x} is provided as a list.}

\item{assay}{For \code{SummarizedExperiment} inputs, assay name or index to use.}

\item{scoring_fn}{Optional custom scoring function. If \code{NULL}, uses the
default row-mean aggregation. Must have signature
\verb{function(x_selected, selected_features, truth, ...)}.}

\item{cohort_aggregator}{Optional transformation applied to \code{x} before
evaluation. Defaults to the aggregator stored in the fitted panel
(currently \code{"pairwise_ratios"}), keeping training and validation pipelines
aligned. Future work: expose richer harmonisation options.}
}
\value{
A list with \code{metrics} (named numeric vector) and \code{objectives}
(data.frame with columns objective, value, direction).
}
\description{
Compute objective values and additional summary statistics for a fitted panel
on validation data. This function extracts the selected features from the
validation set and computes predictions using the default scoring function:
a logistic regression fit on the selected features (with a centred/standardised
fallback if the model fails to converge).
When evaluating multiple cohorts, feature alignment is performed via the
simple intersection of shared column names; future releases will offer more
flexible strategies.
