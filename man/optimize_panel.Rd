\usage{
optimize_panel(
  x,
  y,
  objectives = define_objectives(losses = c("sensitivity", "specificity",
    "num_features")),
  max_features = 5L,
  feature_pool = NULL,
  scoring_fn = NULL,
  nsga_control = list(),
  assay = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{Matrix-like object, \code{SummarizedExperiment}, or list of matrices /
experiments representing one or more cohorts.}

\item{y}{Binary response (\code{factor}, \code{character}, or \code{logical}) aligned with
\code{x}. When \code{x} is a list, \code{y} must be a list of the same length.}

\item{objectives}{Named list of objective descriptors as returned by
\code{\link[=define_objectives]{define_objectives()}}.}

\item{max_features}{Maximum number of biomarkers permitted in a panel.}

\item{feature_pool}{Optional subset of feature identifiers (names or integer
indices) considered during optimization. Defaults to all features.}

\item{scoring_fn}{Function producing per-sample scores from the selected
features. Signature:
\verb{function(x_selected, selected_features, truth, cohort = NULL, ...)}.}

\item{nsga_control}{Named list of arguments passed to \code{\link[mco:nsga2]{mco::nsga2()}}. Defaults
to \code{list(popsize = 64, generations = 60, cprob = 0.7, cdist = 5, mprob = 0.2, mdist = 10)}.}

\item{assay}{For \code{SummarizedExperiment} inputs, assay name or index to use.}
}
\value{
A \code{BiomarkerPanelResult} with Pareto-optimal solutions summarised in
the \code{objectives} slot.
}
\description{
Wrapper around \code{\link[mco:nsga2]{mco::nsga2()}} that composes registered loss functions into a
multi-objective search for compact biomarker panels. Candidate solutions are
represented as weights over a feature pool; the top \code{max_features} features
define a panel whose performance is evaluated via the selected losses.
Inputs may be a single cohort (\code{matrix}, \code{data.frame}, or
\code{SummarizedExperiment}) or multiple cohorts supplied as lists of such objects.
