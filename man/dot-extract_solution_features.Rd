\usage{
.extract_solution_features(panel_result)
}
\arguments{
\item{panel_result}{A \code{\link{BiomarkerPanelResult}}.}
}
\value{
A list where each element corresponds to a Pareto solution and
contains the unique biomarker identifiers selected in that solution. The
list is named by \code{solution_id}.
}
\description{
These helpers support downstream triage of Pareto-optimal solutions produced
by \code{\link[=optimize_panel]{optimize_panel()}}. They implement the three post-hoc decision rules
used in the fetal growth restriction (FGR) analysis: maximising sensitivity
at a fixed specificity, prioritising biomarkers with high selection
frequency, and incorporating pathway-level biological priors.
Extract solution-level feature sets from a \code{BiomarkerPanelResult}.
