\title{Select Ridge-Stable Transferable Features}
\usage{
select_transferable_features(
  x_list,
  y_list,
  n_features = 50L,
  lambda = NULL,
  lambda_choice = c("lambda_1se", "lambda_min"),
  min_coefficient = 0,
  require_sign_consistency = TRUE,
  standardize = TRUE,
  assay = NULL,
  cv_control = list()
)
}
\arguments{
\item{x_list}{A matrix-like object, \code{SummarizedExperiment}, or list of such
objects. Rows represent samples and columns represent features. When a list
is supplied each element is treated as an independent cohort.}

\item{y_list}{A binary response aligned with \code{x_list}. Must be a factor with
levels \code{c("No", "Yes")}. Provide a list when \code{x_list} is a list.}

\item{n_features}{Maximum number of features to return (default \code{50}).}

\item{lambda}{Optional penalty parameter supplied to \code{\link[glmnet:glmnet]{glmnet::glmnet()}}. When
\code{NULL}, cohort-specific values are chosen via cross-validation.}

\item{lambda_choice}{When \code{lambda} is \code{NULL}, choose either \code{"lambda_1se"}
(default) or \code{"lambda_min"} from \code{\link[glmnet:cv.glmnet]{glmnet::cv.glmnet()}} as the operating
point for coefficient extraction.}

\item{min_coefficient}{Minimum absolute coefficient required (applied to the
cohort-wise minimum magnitude) before a feature is considered transferable.}

\item{require_sign_consistency}{If \code{TRUE}, only retain features whose ridge
coefficients share the same sign (ignoring near-zero coefficients) across
cohorts.}

\item{standardize}{Logical; passed to \code{\link[glmnet:glmnet]{glmnet::glmnet()}} to control feature
standardisation prior to fitting. Defaults to \code{TRUE}.}

\item{assay}{For \code{SummarizedExperiment} inputs, the assay name or index to
extract prior to modelling.}

\item{cv_control}{Optional named list of additional arguments forwarded to
\code{\link[glmnet:cv.glmnet]{glmnet::cv.glmnet()}} when \code{lambda} is \code{NULL}.}
}
\value{
A list containing the selected feature identifiers, per-feature
scoring metadata, coefficient matrix, and the lambda value used for each
cohort.
}
\description{
Fits ridge-penalised logistic regression models for each cohort and selects
features whose coefficients are both large in magnitude and consistent across
cohorts. This emphasises biomarkers that deliver transferable signal.
}
\details{
Features are currently aligned across cohorts via a simple
intersection of shared column names. Future versions will add more flexible
harmonisation strategies (e.g., imputation or reference-based mapping).
I promise I'll get to this lol #TODO
