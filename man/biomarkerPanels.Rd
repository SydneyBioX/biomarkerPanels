\title{biomarkerPanels: Multi-objective Optimization for Compact Biomarker Panels}
\description{
The biomarkerPanels package helps researchers derive small, interpretable
biomarker panels that satisfy competing performance criteria such as high
sensitivity at fixed specificity, low assay cost, and robustness across
cohorts. The package integrates with Bioconductor data structures including
\code{SummarizedExperiment} to streamline analysis from expression data to
deployable panel definitions.
