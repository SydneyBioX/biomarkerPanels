\title{Validate Binary Response}
\usage{
ensure_binary_response(y, positive = NULL, negative = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{y}{Vector containing two outcome levels. Accepted types include factor,
character, logical, or numeric. Level names are coerced to the canonical
\code{c("No", "Yes")} order.}

\item{positive}{Optional character vector of value(s) to treat as the
positive (\code{"Yes"}) class. Comparisons are case-insensitive.}

\item{negative}{Optional character vector of value(s) to treat as the
negative (\code{"No"}) class. Comparisons are case-insensitive.}
}
\value{
Factor with levels \code{c("No", "Yes")}.
}
\description{
Ensures that the response vector conforms to the required binary labels.
}
\examples{
ensure_binary_response(c("control", "fgr", "control"))
ensure_binary_response(factor(c("case", "control")), positive = "case")
}
