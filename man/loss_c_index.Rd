\title{Concordance Index (c-index)}
\usage{
loss_c_index(truth, scores = NULL, selected = NULL, positive = "Yes")
}
\arguments{
\item{truth}{Binary outcome; coerced with \code{\link[=ensure_binary_response]{ensure_binary_response()}}.}

\item{scores}{Numeric scores or probabilities.}

\item{selected}{Ignored; kept for signature compatibility.}

\item{positive}{Label treated as the positive ("event") class.}
}
\value{
Concordance index between 0 and 1, or \code{NA_real_} if undefined.
}
\description{
Computes the probability that a random positive instance receives a higher
score than a random negative instance. Equivalent to the AUC for binary
outcomes.
